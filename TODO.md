# 3D Space Shooter Game - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] Install 3D dependencies (three, @types/three, three-stdlib, cannon-es, @use-gesture/react)
- [x] Create main game page structure
- [x] Set up basic 3D scene with Three.js

## Phase 2: Core Game Engine
- [x] Implement game engine foundation with rendering loop
- [x] Create entity-component system for game objects
- [x] Set up physics integration with Cannon.js
- [x] Implement collision detection system

## Phase 3: Player Systems
- [x] Create player ship 3D model and component
- [x] Implement player controller with keyboard/mouse input
- [x] Add player movement physics and controls
- [x] Create weapons system and projectile management

## Phase 4: Enemy AI & Combat
- [x] Implement basic enemy spawning system
- [x] Create enemy AI with different behavior patterns
- [x] Add combat mechanics and hit detection
- [x] Implement damage system and health management

## Phase 5: Game World & Environment
- [x] Create space environment with stars and planets
- [x] Implement particle system for visual effects
- [x] Add dynamic lighting and shadow systems
- [ ] Create environmental hazards and obstacles

## Phase 6: UI & Game Flow
- [x] Build game HUD with health, score, and stats
- [x] Create main menu and game over screens
- [x] Implement pause functionality
- [x] Add game state management

## Phase 7: Audio & Polish
- [ ] Integrate audio system for sound effects
- [ ] Add background music and spatial audio
- [ ] Implement advanced particle effects
- [ ] Performance optimization and mobile compatibility

## Phase 8: Testing & Deployment
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [x] Build and deploy game
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
